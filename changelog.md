## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Regenerated the connector from the Xero Files API specification, using remote methods for all operations.
- Renamed the list and count operations to `listFiles`, `listFolders`, `listFileAssociations`, `listObjectAssociations` and `countAssociations`.
- `Folder` fields are camelCase (`name`, `fileCount`, `email`, `isInbox`, `id`), and `name` is required.
- `FileUploadRequest.body` takes the file as `record {byte[] fileContent; string fileName;}` instead of a base64 string.

### Fixed

- `countAssociations` sends `ObjectIds` as a comma-separated list.
